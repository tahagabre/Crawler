# Crawler Game

## Cloning Crawler Repo:

Go to whatever directory you would like this project to be in.

Run the command:


`git clone https://github.com/tahagabre/Crawler.git`



## Local Development Environment

  

While in the root of this project, you can install dependencies with <br> `npm install` <br>and boot a local http server to run the game with 

`npm run dev` 

<br>The game will now run in a browser, and a watch process will be started so you can change the source and the project will be recompiled and the browser refreshed automatically.

To run the game, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

You will see compilation errors in the terminal. There will also be an error in your console's browser, but it will be gibberish. If it is, then it is a compile error and can be solved through the terminal.

Any other error will be shown, legibly, in the browser.
